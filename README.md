Using a CSV with over 5600 television shows across the four major streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+), we wanted to identify the following informaton:
  - How the target audience varies between platforms?
  - When are most of the shows produced?
  - Differences between IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes?
  - Average ratings for each platform and their highest rated shows?

Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib within Jupyter Notebook, we successfully imported and clean our data to easily identify the data needed to provide answers to our questions.

After seperating each platform and creating charts for each, we easily identified the following trends:
  - Hulu & Netflix focus their content the most on ages 16+.
  - Disney+ focuses primily on content for everyone to enjoy, especially children.
  - All 4 platforms primarily contain content created from 2000 to present day.
  - Across all 4 platforms, shows tend to have a higher Rotten Tomatoes rating than IMDB rating.
  - There is a positive correlation between Rotten Tomato and IMDB ratings.
